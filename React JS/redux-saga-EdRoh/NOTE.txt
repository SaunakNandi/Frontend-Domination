No, the line yield takeEvery('cats/getCatsSuccess', workGetCatsFetch) will not work in this context. Here's why:

Reason:
In Redux-Saga, takeEvery listens for dispatched actions, not for reducer functions. In your case:

getCatsSuccess is a reducer that is invoked automatically when the getCatsSuccess action is dispatched, typically by another function like a saga or a component.
You cannot directly listen to a reducer function like getCatsSuccess in a saga. You can only listen to the action type that corresponds to the action which triggers the reducer.
Correct Way:
To listen for the action that would trigger the getCatsSuccess reducer, you need to dispatch the action type associated with getCatsSuccess. This is similar to how you're handling getCatsFetch.

However, Redux Toolkit's createSlice automatically generates action creators that you should dispatch. The correct approach would be:

You dispatch the action getCatsSuccess somewhere in your workGetCatsFetch saga (or another saga).
You only need to listen for getCatsFetch in your saga, because the saga will likely handle the side effect (like an API call) and then dispatch the success action (getCatsSuccess).
