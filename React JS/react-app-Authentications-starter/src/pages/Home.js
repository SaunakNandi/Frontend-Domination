              This demo app is a simple user management system that allows you to view, add, and edit user information.
              The app displays a list of users with their names, email addresses, and phone numbers. You can click on a
              user to view their details, or you can add a new user by clicking on the "Add User" button. To edit an
              existing user, simply click on the "Edit" button next to their name and make the necessary changes. The
              app is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a clean and modern interface that makes it easy to
              navigate and use. Whether you're a developer looking to learn more about React or just someone who needs a
              simple user management system, this demo app is a great place to start.
